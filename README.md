# Asteroids

An attempt to see if I can write a simple game without a tutorial.

Only thing used here that is not mine is the [ScreenWrap code](https://github.com/sp33dy/Godot-v3-Tutorials-Competent/tree/master/Screen%20Wrap%20Node/ScreenWrap) - since I wanted to focus on the actual movement controls etc at the moment.
